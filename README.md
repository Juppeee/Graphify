/////       About Graphify     //////

Graphify (working title) is a desktop application for creating 2D-graphs out of user inputted data. The goal of the app 
is to be functional, intuitive and stable.

Graphify is my first free-standing Java app. Thus the project is as much about me exploring the possibilities of Java
as it is about creating a functioning little desktop app. Feedback on the project is appreciated,

What's working:

- you can actually draw graphs now (hurray!)
- a vast majority of GUI elements are working properly
- user data can be manually added one datapoint at time or imported from a correctly formatted CSV file

What's missing:

- you can't save created graphs yet (I'm working on this one next)
- graphs drawn are still missing some components, like axis names, grids, etc. 
- the swing layout manager isn't handling the GUI components quite right yet, though the GUI looks convincing when not resized
- many small features like drawing the grid, filtering input data and resizing graphs are still absent
